# Sparkify User Churn Prediction

## Overview

### What is churn Prediction?
Churn prediction is knowing which users are going to stop using your platform in the future. My project is Predicting Sparkify User Churn with Sparkify JSON Log File

### Objective and Background
The dataset is Sparky, which is a streaming service user log file similar to Spotify. The aim of the project is to build up a machine learning model to predict user churn (cancellation) using pyspark.

#### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* pyspark.sql,
* pyspark.ml,
* datetime,
* Numpy,
* Pandas


##### Methodology


- Define Target Variable (churn) and Exploratory Analysis
- Feature Engineering (Create New Feature and Transformation)
- Modeling (Random forest, logistic regression, SVM and gradient boosting tree)
- Evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score)
